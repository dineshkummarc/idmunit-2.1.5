TriVir Licensing Policies


TriVir, LLC distributes IdMUnit under two licensing options. You can use IdMUnit
under an Open Source License by downloading it from www.IdMUnit.org.
Alternatively, you can acquire a Commercial License by contacting TriVir, LLC
at www.trivir.com. The sections below are intended to provide you with
information about our licensing policies so that you can determine which license
is the best fit for your needs, and so that you can understand other important
aspects of your IdMUnit license.


1 - Licensing Introduction and Guidelines 

TriVir, LLC is committed to providing the open source community with world-class
technologies. IdMUnit represents commercial quality software. We believe that
the open source licensing option is an effective means through which to
cultivate community interest, education and development around identity
management technologies.

Our flexible licensing alternatives are intended to balance the following
fundamental objectives:

* Provide the open source community with premium quality technology 

* Foster the ongoing evolution of IdMUnit through community contributions and
  through our own continued investments

* Provide a means through which IdMUnit community members can quickly learn
  about IdMUnit and evaluate its use for various purposes

* Permit organizations to examine and test the quality of our technologies prior
  to engaging in commercial relationships with us, when appropriate

Below are some guidelines to help you determine which of our licensing
alternatives might be the best fit for you. If you have questions about which
license to use, you can contact us at info@trivir.com.

* If you license your software to others under the GNU General Public License
  (GPL) as defined by the Free Software Foundation, then use TriVir, LLC’s
  Open Source License.

* If you wish to redistribute any IdMUnit technology with your closed source
  "proprietary" software, and/or you require product-level technical support,
  then you can purchase a commercial license.

In addition to the guidelines provided above, the sections that follow give more
specific information about licensing, code contributions, and our policies on
patents and trademarks. Please read these sections carefully, as they are
intended to help you understand your responsibilities when you use IdMUnit
technology.


2 - Open Source and Commercial Licenses 

TriVir, LLC is an open source software contributor that licenses and
distributes IdMUnit technology. TriVir, LLC offers you two licensing options:

* Open Source License. If you are developing open source applications,
  TriVir, LLC distributes its IdMUnit technology primarily under the GNU
  General Public License. However, because IdMUnit technology includes some
  software written and licensed by others, certain parts of the IdMUnit
  technology are covered by other open source license agreements, such as the
  Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL). In this Licensing Policies 
  statement, the open source licenses that collectively cover IdMUnit’s
  technologies are referred to as the "Open Source Licenses." To review the
  licenses that cover the various modules of IdMUnit, see our Licensing Details.
  Making our product available under Open Source Licenses allows you to freely
  modify our software and redistribute it, as long as you do so under the terms
  of the Open Source Licenses. IdMUnit technology is licensed free of charge and
  is provided "AS IS." Because IdMUnit technology is offered free of charge,
  TriVir, LLC does not take on any liability for performance or intellectual
  property matters for this software.

* Commercial Licenses. If you are developing commercial applications and/or
  you require product technical support, TriVir, LLC licenses its
  IdMUnit software under the terms of a commercial, closed-source license 
  agreement. OEMs, resellers, systems integrators and government users 
  typically prefer a commercial license.

If you are not sure which license to use, you can always test the TriVir
engine under the GPL license and inspect the source code before you purchase a
commercial license.


3 - Changes to Our Licensing Policies 

We believe that our commercial and open source software communities can work
together. We will be striving over time to streamline our licensing policies
to provide the optimal balance of access to our open source products and
commercial viability for our commercial products. We hope to achieve the
maximum synergy between these two models: contributions from the open source
community will help make our products robust and adaptable, and development
resources from our privately-funded commercial operations will help fuel the
development of our open source products.

Because we want to accomplish this balance, the dual licensing policy of
TriVir, LLC is a work in progress. So, from time to time, we may change this 
policy. For instance, we may modify the Open Source License terms we offer. 
But, of course, if you receive a license to our code under an Open Source 
License, and we subsequently change our licensing policy, this will not
terminate the rights you have already been granted. Any changes will be changes
going forward.


4 - Contributions and Code Base Sharing 

We encourage contributions to our code base from the open source community.
Like most open source projects, we will maintain the code base for our
official releases; contributions you offer may or may not be included. Any
code included in our open source code base will be made available under our
Open Source License terms.

However, because we also offer a commercial licensing model, we may use
contributions to our open source code base in our commercially licensed
products as well. We believe this is consistent with the spirit of free
software, because nothing will prevent you from making your contributions
available under open source licensing terms. We simply ask that you allow us
to include your contributions in our commercial products as well.

If you wish to contribute to the IdMUnit code base, you must agree to the
terms of our Code Contribution Agreement. We cannot accept contributions
unless you agree to these terms. This helps protect us, and the open source
community, from liability for intellectual property infringement. It also
ensures that we will not have to commit resources to legal disputes about code
you contribute. We would rather use those resources to improve our software.


5 - Patents 


From time to time, TriVir, LLC may file for and obtain patents in the United 
States or any other country. An important reason to pursue patents is to prevent 
others from bringing patent infringement lawsuits that would make our products 
unavailable under our Open Source Licenses. We will not exercise our patents 
to take a "second bite at the apple." In other words, if any code you received 
from us under an Open Source License falls within the scope of any claim of any 
of our patents, we will not use that patent to prevent you from exercising your 
license to that code. The following is a more formal declaration of our patent 
policy:

To the extent you make, use, offer to sell, or sell products including or
embodying software licensed to you by TriVir, LLC under an Open Source
License and such software infringes any claim of any patent owned by TriVir, LLC 
("TriVir"), TriVir shall not enforce such patent against you in connection with 
such making, use, offer to sell or sale of such product. The foregoing does not 
apply if the infringement arises from modifications to the licensed software made 
by any party other than TriVir.  The foregoing will be void with respect to you 
if you bring a patent infringement claim against TriVir or any of its affiliates 
(including without limitation cross-claims or counterclaims). The foregoing will 
not be construed as an assurance that such patents are enforceable or that the 
exercise of rights under such patents does not infringe the patent or other 
intellectual property rights of any other entity.

6 - Trademarks 

We offer our software under Open Source Licenses, so you will have the freedom
to change it. But there is a difference between copyright in software and
trademark rights. We strictly enforce our trademark rights - we must, in order
to keep them valid. There are significant restrictions on your ability to use
the TriVir, LLC and IdMUnit name and logos, even when built into binaries that we
provide.

7 - Trademark Notices 

You must not remove our trademarks from our binaries. You may truthfully state
that an unmodified version of our software is TriVir software, as long as
you include the appropriate notice language described below. However, if you
are distributing copies over a Web site, we ask that you do this by providing
a link directly to our site, rather than offering it on your own server. We
require this because the speed and reliability of the server will bear upon
our reputation and affect our rights in our trademark.

In addition, you must insure that you are properly identifying TriVir, LLC
as the source of the IdMUnit technology. Otherwise, you will be
incorrectly implying that you are the source of our software. You must do this
even if you have modified the IdMUnit software as allowed under the Open
Source Licenses. Therefore, to avoid violating our trademark rights, you
should use trademarks and notices as follows:

* If you are redistributing unmodified versions of our software as made
  available on our Web site, you must not remove our trademarks from
  unmodified binaries. Thus, any of our notices or logos that are embedded in
  the IdMUnit software must remain visible to the user.

* If you are redistributing modified versions of our software, you must
  include a notice stating: "This product includes software used under license
  from TriVir, LLC, but it is not an TriVir product and has not been
  tested, endorsed, or approved by TriVir, LLC."

* If you are redistributing either unmodified or modified versions of the
  IdMUnit technology, you must prominently place a notice saying "Powered
  by TriVir" on the packaging, promotional content (e.g. brochures, press
  releases, website copy), and about screens for your software. You must also
  follow the Trademark Guidelines on the proper use of our trademarks.

Our trademarks symbolize our reputation and identity, so their proper use is
important. You would need a formal license from us in order to use our
trademarks in a way that states or suggests that we sponsor, endorse, or are
otherwise affiliated with your project or use. You do not need a formal
license agreement in order to make purely informational references to our
trademarks (such as in a product review or article), but even informational
references should follow our Trademark Guidelines. Provided that you follow
these guidelines, you may link to www.trivir.com. However, the context and
implementation of those links must make it clear that you are not endorsed by
or affiliated with us, but are simply linking to our site or our software.
Please e-mail us at info@trivir.com if you have any questions about
the use of our trademarks.



8 - Trademark Guidelines 

The first or most prominent mention of our trademark, IdMUnit, as well as
any of our other trademarks identified below, should be accompanied by the
letters TM in superscript and an asterisk immediately to the right, e.g.:
IdMUnit TM*. Somewhere nearby in legible typeface should be an asterisk
with a notation reading: IdMUnit is a trademark of TriVir, LLC, and is
used under license.

We may register this (and other) trademarks in the future, at which time it
would be appropriate to replace the TM symbol with the registered trademark
symbol (®). We will post a notice here if this happens.

It is not necessary to use trademark symbols at every mention of a mark in
running text. Instead, the first and most prominent references to a particular
mark such as in headers on a web page, the beginning and ending of
presentations, login or welcome screens, product media, and advertising or
promotional materials in all media.

Trademarks Should Be Used as Adjectives and in Their Proper Form. Trademarks
should be used as adjectives followed by a generic term for instance,
IdMUnit technology. The spelling and syntax of marks should never be
varied - no words should be omitted or abbreviated, nor should acronyms be
used in place of specific marks.

A current list of our trademarks appears below. Any questions about proper use
for a specific display should be directed to info@trivir.com.
